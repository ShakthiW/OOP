## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design applications and computer programs. OOP is a powerful tool for creating modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

In OOP, an object is a self-contained entity that contains both data and code. The data is the state of the object, and the code is the behavior of the object. Objects can interact with each other by sending and receiving messages.

There are four main concepts in OOP:

* **Abstraction:** Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential information about an object. This allows us to focus on how to use an object without having to know how it works internally.
* **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and code together into a single unit. This allows us to protect the data from unauthorized access and modification.
* **Inheritance:** Inheritance is the ability of one object to inherit the properties and behavior of another object. This allows us to reuse code and create new objects without having to start from scratch.
* **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on different forms. This allows us to write code that is more flexible and reusable.

## Java as the Programming Language

Java is a popular programming language that is well-suited for OOP. Java has a number of features that make it easy to create and use objects, such as:

* **Classes:** Classes are used to define the blueprint for objects. A class contains the data and code that is common to all objects of that type.
* **Objects:** Objects are instances of classes. Objects have their own unique state and can interact with other objects by sending and receiving messages.
* **Methods:** Methods are the code that defines the behavior of an object. Methods can be used to access and modify the object's state.
* **Constructors:** Constructors are used to initialize the state of an object when it is created.

## OOP Tutorials in This Repository

This repository contains a number of OOP tutorials that are based on university modules. The tutorials are written in Java and cover a variety of topics, including:

* Introduction to OOP
* Classes and objects
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Interfaces and abstract classes
* Collections
* Generics
* Exception handling

## Getting Started

To get started with the tutorials, you will need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK). Once you have installed the JDK, you can compile and run the tutorials using the following commands:

```
javac Tutorial.java
java Tutorial
```

For more information on how to use Java, please see the following resources:

* Oracle Java documentation: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/
* Java tutorial: contact me for the tutorials 


## Conclusion

Object-oriented programming is a powerful tool for creating modular, reusable, and maintainable code. The tutorials in this repository will help you to learn the basics of OOP and Java.
